Weather API
This is a simple Node.js server that fetches real-time weather data for multiple cities using an external weather API. It exposes a /getWeather endpoint that accepts the names of multiple cities as input and responds with the real-time weather results.

Requirements
Node.js (v12 or higher)
npm (Node Package Manager)
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd weather-api
Install the dependencies:
Copy code
npm install
Configuration
Obtain an API key from a weather API provider (e.g., WeatherAPI).
Replace the placeholder <YOUR_API_KEY> in the code with your actual API key.
Usage
Start the server:
sql
Copy code
npm start
The server will start running on http://localhost:3000.

Send a POST request to the /getWeather endpoint with the list of cities in the request body. For example, using cURL:
json
Copy code
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"cities":["toronto","mumbai","london"]}' http://localhost:3000/getWeather
Replace http://localhost:3000 with the appropriate URL if your server is running on a different address or port.

The server will fetch the real-time weather data for each city and respond with the weather results in JSON format.
